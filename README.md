I made a discord bot to be able to check for your Dead By Daylight stats on discord

You are able to check for your Survivor and Killer stats using the bot and it will also link you to a website where you can see more in-depth stats. 
It currently links to another site, but will link to mine once it has been finished.

You can only pull stats for users that play Dead By Daylight on Steam. There is no other publicly available API for all platforms.

Commands:
1. "!survivor https://steamcommunity.com/id/VulcanHD/" - Get your Survivor stats for the steam account linked
2. "!killer https://steamcommunity.com/id/VulcanHD/" - Get your Killer stats for the steam account linked
3. "!help" - Show a embed on discord with all the commands you can use on the bot
4. "!faq" - Show user all Frequently Asked Questions in an embed on discord
5. "!broken" - What to do if the bot is broken
6. "!platforms" - An explanation as to why you can only pull game stats on Steam platform

Features:
1. Check Survivor Stats
2. Check Killer Stats
3. Links to external site to see more in-depth stats
4. Automatically creates channel when joining new discord
5. Only listens to commands in specific discord channel
